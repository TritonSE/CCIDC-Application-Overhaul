        Certified Interior Designers (CIDs) must fulfill CCIDC&#39;s education, experience, and exam
        criteria to achieve the designation of &#34;Certified Interior Designer&#34;. CCIDC is
        backed by The Certified Interior Designers Title Act which is governed by California
        Business & Professions Codes Sections 5800-5812. CIDs, recognized as skilled professionals,
        are authorized to develop and submit non-structural construction documents, demonstrating
        expertise in the California Building Code. Upon qualification, CIDs receive a unique
        identification number, a certificate, a stamp for nonstructural drawings, and an ID card,
        symbolizing their unwavering commitment to upholding high professional standards and ethical
        conduct.
